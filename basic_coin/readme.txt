This is my first dapp, a basic coin mintable and tranferable.
Can be minted only by the owner.
If you have this coin in your address then you can tranfer it too.

Uses web3.js and web3 providers to interact with JSON-RPC server. 
Providing user with a simple web interface to interact with the ethereum smart contract.
Contract can be deployed on the testrpc network using remix ethereum ide.
